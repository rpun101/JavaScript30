    // start with strings, numbers and booleans

    // Let's say we have an array
    const players = ['Wes', 'Sarah', 'Ryan', 'Poppy'];

    // and we want to make a copy of it.

    // You might think we can just do something like this:
    const newPlayers = players;
    // console.table(players);
    // console.table(newPlayers);

    // however what happens when we update that array?
    players.push('Odel');
    newPlayers.push('Bechkham');
    // console.log(players);
    // console.log(newPlayers);

    // now here is the problem!

    // oh no - we have edited the original array too!

    // Why? It's because that is an array reference, not an array copy. They both point to the same array!

    // So, how do we fix this? We take a copy instead!
    let team = Array.from(players);
    team[2] = 'brown';
    console.log(players, team);

    // one way

    // or create a new array and concat the old one in

    // or use the new ES6 Spread
    let es6CopyArray = [...players];
    es6CopyArray[1] = 'cousin';
    console.log(players, es6CopyArray);

    // now when we update it, the original one isn't changed

    // The same thing goes for objects, let's say we have a person object

    // with Objects
    const person = {
      name: 'Wes Bos',
      age: 80
    };

    // and think we make a copy:
    let employee = person;
    employee.salary = 5000;
    console.log(person, employee);

    // how do we take a copy instead?
    let manager = Object.assign({}, person, {location: 'Bloomington' }, {oblly: 'paope'});
    //manager.location = 'Wells Fargo';
    console.log(person, manager);

    // We will hopefully soon see the object ...spread

    // Things to note - this is only 1 level deep - both for Arrays and Objects. lodash has a cloneDeep method, but you should think twice before using it.
